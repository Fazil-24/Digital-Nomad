# Digital-Nomad-Companion
Digital Nomad Companion is a multi-agent AI assistant built using Amazon Bedrock’s agent orchestration. It combines the power of specialized sub-agents with a supervisor agent that ensures smooth, contextual coordination between them.
The agents include:
1.	Job Search Agent – Searches and recommends latest remote-friendly jobs using Serper Web Search API.
2.	House Broker Agent – Helps find rental homes or co-living spaces based on your preferences.
3.	Guide Agent – Curates top-rated places to explore based on your current city and mood.
4.	Fashion Advisor Agent – Suggests outfits and trends based on your current location (don’t wear shorts in Paris in March!).
5.	Supervisor Agent – Coordinates all other agents and selects the best one to handle your query.

All wrapped in a clean Streamlit interface that runs smoothly on your local machine.
